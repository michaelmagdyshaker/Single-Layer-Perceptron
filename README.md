# Single-Layer-Perceptron
Implementation the single layer Perceptron learning algorithm on a single layer neural networks which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.

Useing the iris data in both the training and testing processes. (Each class has 50 samples: train NN with 30 non-repeated samples randomly selected, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)

Iris dataset contains 150 samples (50 samples/class). Each sample consists of 4 features.
The first part of task(1) is drawing all possible combinations of features like (X1, X2),
(X1, X3), (X1, X4), (X2, X3), (X2, X4), and (X3, X4) as shown in the following 
figure and determine which features are discriminative.
